This directory is the only one that contains more than one project.
In here are libft, ft_printf and get_next_line.

Libft was the first project in the core curiculum. The subject of this project was to write your own standard library to use in future projects.
In this project were no external functions allowed except of malloc and write.

Ft_printf was about recoding the printf function but without floating point conversion. The usage of libft is forbidden in this project.
Allowed functions: malloc, free, write, va_start, va_arg, va_copy, va_end

In get_next_line the subject was to write a function that returns one line of a file as string at each call. Usage of libft was forbidden.
Allowed functions: read, malloc, free

The files get_next_line.c and get_next_line_utils.c belong to get_next_line.
ft_printf.c, ft_base.c, ft_putchar_new.c, ft_putstr_new.c and ft_putptr.c are part of ft_printf.
And last but not least the rest of the files are from libft.
