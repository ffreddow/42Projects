Here are all the projects from 42-school I finished so far.

The projects have the same name as the directories they are in. A detailed description is provided inside each project directory.
All projects can be compiled by a simple make. "make bonus" for projects where I mention a bonus part. 

Table of content:

libft:  Inside this directory are three projects combined.
        The first project in which I had to write my own library.
        The second project where I recoded the printf function from stdio.h but without the floatingpoint conversion.
        The third project where I wrote a funtion that returns one line of a file at a time.
        
so_long:  This project was about writing a small 2D-Game

pipex:  A recode of the pipe command.

Im currently working on so_long which is about writing a sorting algorithm.

If you wonder why I dont use for loops, do...while loops, switch cases and goto: They are forbidden in all C-Projects.

For any question message me on Discord: Ffreddow#3766
